# Task-manager
as a amateur developer. I believe many apps are lacking in the need of personal needs. we use many apps for many diffirent functions, people with ADHD like me may forget using other apps or suffer with using other apps for their needs. This app I am developing is a app thats supposed to be a milestone for my development career.
